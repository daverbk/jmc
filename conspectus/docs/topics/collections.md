## The `Collection` Interface

### `Collection` and `List`

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Collection {
        add(E e)
        addAll(Collection)
        clear()
        contains(Object o)
        containsAll(Collection)
        iterator()
        remove(Object o)
        removeAll(Collection)
        removeIf(Predicate)
        retainAll(Collection)
    }
    class List {
        add(int index, E element)
        get(int index)
        indexOf(Object o)
        lastIndexOf(Object o)
        listIterator()
        of()
        remove(int index)
        set(int index, E element)
        sort(Comparator)
        subList(int fromIndex, int toIndex)
    }
    <<Interface>> Collection
    <<Interface>> List
    Collection <|-- List
```

### `List` implementations

* A list can be either indexed, as an ArrayList, or not, like a LinkedList, but a LinkedList is implemented to support all
    of these methods as well
* A List is An ordered collection
* `ArrayList` is sequenced in memory

```mermaid

flowchart
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
```

```mermaid
---
title: LinkedList

flowchart
    element1 --> element2
    element2 --> element1
    element2 --> element3
    element3 --> element2
    element3 --> element4
    element4 --> element3
    element4 --> element5
    element5 --> element4
```

### `Queue`

* Most often these may be implemented as First In, First Out (FIFO), but can be implemented like a Stack, as Last In First
Out (LIFO)

:::note
Deque supports both
:::

### `Set`

* A Set is a collection conceptually based off of a mathematical set
* It contains no duplicate elements, and isn't naturally sequenced or ordered
* A Sorted Set is a set that provides a total ordering of the elements

#### `HashSet`, `LinkedHashSet`, `EnumSet`

| Operation    | Time complexity |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `add()`      | `O(1)`*         |
| `remove()`   | `O(1)`          |
| `contains()` | `O(1)`          |

* All of that thanks to the internal `HashMap` implementation
* `O(1)`* - amortized (as in the worst case scenario it will take `O(n)` if the rehashing of all elements is required when
    the `Initial Capacity` is reached)

#### When creating `hashCode()`

1. It should be very fast to compute
2. It should produce a consistent result each time it's called
3. Objects that are considered equal should produce the same hashCode
4. Values used in the calculation should not be mutable

#### `TreeSet`

##### Time complexity

| Operation    | Time complexity |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `add()`      | `O(long(n))`    |
| `remove()`   | `O(long(n))`    |
| `contains()` | `O(long(n))`    |

* The `O(long(n))` time complexity is caused by the Btree structure and the need to traverse the tree and keep it
  balanced

##### Interface hierarchy

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Collection
    class Set
    class SortedSet {
        first()
        last()
        headSet()
        tailSet()
        comparator()
    }
    class NavigableSet {
        ceiling()
        floor()
        higher()
        lower()
        descendingSet()
        
        Implementations:
        â€£ TreeSet
    }
    <<Interface>> Collection
    <<Interface>> Set
    <<Interface>> SortedSet
    <<Interface>> NavigableSet
    Collection <|-- Set
    Set <|-- SortedSet
    SortedSet <|-- NavigableSet
```

* Elements which implement Comparable (said to have a natural order sort, like Strings and numbers) can be elements of a
  TreeSet
* If our elements don't implement Comparable, you must pass a Comparator to the constructor

##### `SortedSet` methods

| sub set methods                                                                                                           | inclusive                                                                                  | description                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `headSet(E toElement)`<br/>`headSet(E toElement, boolean inclusive)`                                                      | `toElement` is exclusive if not specified                                                  | returns all elements less than the passed `toElement` (unless `inclusive` is specifically included)           |
| `tailSet(E fromElement)`<br/>`tailSet(E toElement, boolean inclusive)`                                                    | `fromElement` is inclusive if not specified                                                | returns all elements greater than or equal to the `fromElement` (unless `inclusive` is specifically included) |
| `subSet(E fromElement, E toElement)`<br/>`subSet(E fromElement, boolean fromInclusive, E toElement, boolean toInclusive)` | `fromElement` is inclusive if not specified,<br/>`toElement` is exclusive if not specified | returns elements greater than or equal to `fromElement` and less than `toElement`                             |


* All three methods, headSet, tailSet and subSet return a subset of elements, backed by the original set

##### `NavigableSet` methods

|------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| In Set     | Matched Element        | Next Element < Element<br/> or null if none found | Matched Element	       | Next Element > Element<br/>or null if none found   |
|
| Not In Set | Next Element < Element | Next Element < Element<br/> or null if none found | Next Element > Element | Next Element > Element <br/> or null if none found |

##### When to use

* If the number of elements is not large, or we want a collection that's sorted, and continuously re-sorted as we add
  and remove elements, and that shouldn't contain duplicate elements, the `TreeSet` is a good alternative to
  the `ArrayList`

## [`Map`](https://www.baeldung.com/java-hashmap-advanced)

* A Map is a collection that stores key and value pairs
* The keys are a set, and the values are a separate collection, where the key keeps a reference to a value
* Keys need to be unique, but values don't
* Elements in a tree are stored in a key value Node, also called an Entry

### Implementation

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Map~K,V~ {
        Set~K~ ketSet()
        Set~Map.Entry~K;V~~ entrySet()
        Collection~V~ values()
    }
    class HashMap~K,V~ {
        Node[] table    
    }  
    class `Map.Entry`~K,V~
    class `HashMap.Node`~K,V~
    Map <|-- HashMap : implements
    `Map.Entry` <|-- `HashMap.Node` : implements
    Map *-- `Map.Entry`
    HashMap *-- `HashMap.Node`
```

* The set returned from the `keySet` method, is backed by the map
* This means changes to the map are reflected in the set, and vice-versa
* The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the map
* You can use the methods `remove`, `removeAll`, `retainAll`, and `clear`
* It does not support the `add` or `addAll` operations

### `HashMap`, `LinkedHashMap`

* The `HashMap` maintains an array of `Nodes`, in a field called `table`, whose size is managed by Java, and whose
  indices are determined by hashing functions
* The LinkedHashMap is a key value entry collection, whose keys are ordered by insertion order

| Operation    | Time complexity |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `add()`      | `O(1)`*         |
| `remove()`   | `O(1)`          |
| `contains()` | `O(1)`          |

### `TreeMap`

* `TreeMap` is a map implementation that keeps its entries sorted according to the natural ordering of its keys or better
  still using a comparator if provided by the user at construction time
* `TreeMap` implements `NavigableMap` interface and bases its internal working on the principles of red-black trees

| Operation    | Time complexity |
|--------------|-----------------|
| `add()`      | `O(long(n))`    |
| `remove()`   | `O(long(n))`    |
| `contains()` | `O(long(n))`    |

#### `TreeMap`'s View collections

| View collection methods                                                                                                  | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `entrySet()`, `keySet()`, `values()`                                                                                     | Provides views of mappings, keys and values. These are views available to any map, and not just the `TreeMap`.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `descendingKeySet()`, `descendingKeyMap()`                                                                               | Provides reversed order key set or map, reversed by the key values                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `headMap(K key)`,<br/>`headMap(K key, boolean inclusive)`,<br/>`tailMap(K key)`,<br/>`tailMap(K key, boolean inclusive)` | Provides views of either the first or last parts of the map, divided by the key passed<br/>The head map is by default EXCLUSIVE of all elements higher or equal to the key<br/>The tail map is by default INCLUSIVE of all elements higher or equal to the key |
| `subMap(K fromKey, K toKey)`,<br/>`subMap(K fromKey, boolean inclusive, K toKey, boolean inclusive)`                     | Provides a view of a contiguous section of the map, higher or equal to the `fromKey` and lower than the `toKey`, so the toKey is EXCLUSIVE<br/>The overloaded version allows you to determine the inclusivity you want for both keys                           |

#### `EnumSet` and `EnumMap`

##### `EnumSet`

* The `EnumSet` is a specialized Set implementation for use with enum values
* All the elements in an EnumSet must come from a single enum type
* The `EnumSet` is abstract, meaning we can't instantiate it directly
* It comes with many factory methods to create instances
* In general, this set has much better performance than using a HashSet, with an enum type
* Bulk operations (such as `containsAll` and `retainAll`) should run very quickly, in constant time, `O(1)`, if they're run
  on an `enumSet`, and their argument is an EnumSet

##### Two Types of `EnumSet` implementations

* Enum sets are represented internally as bit vectors, which is just a series of ones and zeros
* A one indicates that the enum constant (with an ordinal value that is equal to the index of the bit) is in the set
* A zero indicates the enum constant is not in the set
* Using a bit vector allows all set operations to use bit math, which makes it very fast
* A `RegularEnumSet` uses a single long as its bit vector, which means it can contain a maximum of 64 bits, representing
  64 enum values
* A `JumboEnumSet` gets returned if you have more than 64 enums


##### `EnumMap`

* The Enum Map is a specialized Map implementation for use with enum type keys
* The keys must all come from the same enum type, and they're ordered naturally by the ordinal value of the enum
  constants
* This map has the same functionality as a HashMap, with `O(1)` for basic operations
* The enum key type is specified during construction of the EnumMap, either explicitly by passing the key type's class,
  or implicitly by passing another EnumSet
* In general, this map has better performance than using a HashMap, with an enum type
